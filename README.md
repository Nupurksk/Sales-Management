# Sales-Management

It is a Data File Handling project I made in High School. It is written in C++. The Car Sales Management System tracks entries and gives the users some management functionalities using data file handling in C++.

Working
The program starts off with a welcome screen, followed by a prompt for the user to make entries into the data file system. After the user makes initial enteries (As many as they want), they are given a menu of operations. The program then becomes a menu-driven program which performs file management operations as long as the user decides to quit. The system basically uses an identification key (VIN Number, which is unique for each vehicle) to track the entries in the files and make changes in them, if needed.
